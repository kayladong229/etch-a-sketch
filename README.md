# etch-a-sketch
A web application based on the game Etch-a-Sketch, created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. When the user clicks on the button at the top, they are prompted to enter a number. Upon prompt submission, a square grid is created that is divided into smaller squares. The user can also click the button again to create a grid with differently sized squares.

When the user moves their mouse cursor over the smaller squares, the squares change into a random color. The same square can even become a different color when the cursor hovers over it again.
